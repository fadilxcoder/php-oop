# PHP OOP Notes

- PHP does not support multiple inheritance. `Traits` are used to solve this, like an abstract class, you cannot instantiate it.
- `Overriding` is extending a class and then create same method name to override parent method
- `Final` prevent child classes from overriding a method & a `Final` declared class cannot be extended.
